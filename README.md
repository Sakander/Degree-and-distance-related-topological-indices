# Degree-and-distance-related-topological-indices
Computing degree and distance based topological indices of general graphs

Let G be a graph for which you would like to compute a distance-based topological index.

Step 1. Draw G on newGraph and check distance matrix as an invariant by going to "Invariants" tab to "Select Invariant".

Copy the distance matrix by right clicking on the matrix.

Step 2. Paste the matrix and order of G in the ModifiedSzeged.m file in B and n resepctively.

Run the ModifiedSzeged.m file to obtain your result.
